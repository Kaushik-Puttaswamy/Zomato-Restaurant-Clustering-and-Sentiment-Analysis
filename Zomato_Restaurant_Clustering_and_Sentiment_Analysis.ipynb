However, lemmatization uses a dictionary-based approach and considers the context of the word in order to determine its base form, while stemming uses simple heuristics and does not consider the context of the word.

        "Stemming can be used because they are common normalization techniques used in natural language processing to preprocess text data before it is fed into a model.

This is because, as the number of features increases, the computational cost of clustering algorithms also increases. In addition, high dimensionality can lead to the \"curse of dimensionality\", where the data becomes sparse and the clusters become harder to identify. Dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, or LLE can help reduce the number of features while maintaining the important information in the data, making it easier to cluster and interpret the results."

These patterns, known as principal components, are linear combinations of the original features that are uncorrelated with each other. By using the first few principal components, which account for the majority of the variation in the data, one can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the data while maintaining most of the important information.\n",

Additionally, PCA can be used for data visualization by projecting high-dimensional data onto a 2D or 3D space for easy visualization.\n",

The advantage of this approach is that it can help to remove noise and correlated features from the data, which can make the clustering results more interpretable.
